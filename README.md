# how to install & run

`npm install ; npm run start` will start the dev server.

`npm install ; npm run build` will build a production package.

## running

- going to `./index.html` directly will generate a seed for you
- going to `./index.html?seed=<seed>` will use that seed instead.

# about

## what we are

this is a program that autogenerates a very basic language comprising of
pronunciation, syntax, and grammar.

## what we aren't

- a replacement for conlanging - think of us like an oven that bakes cakes, and
  you're the designer that puts on the icing
- a program that generates original language features â€“ more complex stuff like
  alignment and non-standard phonetics will still be the domain of humans
- a commercial product - we will never charge money for any iteration of this
  product
- an academic study on autogenerating language (however, if you have any tips
  or comments, we are open to hearing them!)
