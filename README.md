# how to install & run

- install [node+npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- install [browserify](http://browserify.org/) (`npm install -g browserify`)
- run something like `browserify main.js -o serene.js --standalone serene`
  - if you want to run it on the browser then `./compile.sh` will automatically do this for you
- go to `index.html` and the magic should happen automatically (may take some time though)

or if in the future we have a release you can download the packaged stuff there.

# about

## what we are

this is a program that autogenerates a very basic language comprising of pronunciation, syntax, and grammar.

## what we aren't

- a replacement for conlanging - think of us like an oven that bakes cakes, and you're the designer that puts on the icing
- a program that generates original language features â€“ more complex stuff like alignment and non-standard phonetics will still be the domain of humans
- a commercial product - we will never charge money for any iteration of this product
- an academic study on autogenerating language (however, if you have any tips or comments, we are open to hearing them!)
